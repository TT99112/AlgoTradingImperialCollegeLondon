The idea is that the trading period is split into 10000 intervals and during each of these intervals the available limit orders are stored. Sub- columns store the price limit and volume of all bid and ask orders currently in the LOB. The index then corresponds to each individual limit order. Once the code block below has executed don't run it again as it takes a fairly long time to run and also it will change the resultant dataframe as it relies on random number

The weight function that we will use is the volume_curve function defined above. For a percent of volume calculation there is only one input parameter (the precent of volume) so at each time index this percent of all total volume mut be calculated and then used to determine how many limit orders are filled at each timestep.\n","\n","The main drawback of such a limit order book model is that it is static. Usually market orders coming through can then trigger more orders or lead to a reduction in future orders. As the limit order book is fixed while the algorithms are running we do not model this. Modelling these effects is complex although mathematical models have been developed to model trade propagation effects.
